### Learnt things from this Project
1. Learnt to build a new visual (Calendar visual) using matrix table, which can be utilized for different purpose of analyze.
This visual, when hovered over a calendar date, displays the performance metrics for the business, providing an easy-to-understand snapshot of the hotel's performance over time.
